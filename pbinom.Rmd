# Question 3
```{r}
dbinom(0, 6, 2/3)
```
# Question 4 (prob to observe 4 or fewer) sum of probabilities of observing 0 thru 4

```{r}
pbinom(4, 6, 2/3)
```

#question 5 (prob of observing 4 or more, aka 3 or fewer)
basically the pbinom function gives you the cumulative probability including the number you give in so pbinom(4,6,⅔) gives you the probabilities up to and including 4 so if you subtract that from 1 you’re getting rid of p(4) so what you need to do instead is subtract the probabilities of 0 1 2 and 3 and you do that by doing 1-pbinom(3,6,⅔)
```{r}
pbinom(3, 6, 2/3)
1 - pbinom(3, 6, 2/3)
```
